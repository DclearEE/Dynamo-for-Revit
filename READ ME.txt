Everything in these folders is for Dynamo 1.3.2. There is no way to tell what version a file is unless you label it.

If you are using anything above Dynamo 1.3.2 follow these steps

1)	Copy the file you want to open
2)	Save it with the version of Dynamo you are using at the end i.e. (Dynamo 2.0)
3)	Do no save 1.3.2 as 2.0 files with out making a duplicate. Dan will not like you
