# Dynamo for Revit

Programs and scripts that help automate tasks in Revit.
Mainly electrical scripts with standard project setup, maintance and general Revit tasks sprinkled in.

All files are Dynamo file (.dyn), with some custom Python scripts inside.


# Overview of Dynamo and Revit versions and Compatability

All files in this Git are written for Dynamo version 1.3.2 unless otherwise noted.

 Summary of Dynamo Versions:
 
	Dynamo 1.3.2 supports Revit 2016, 2017 & 2018 (but not 2019)
		*This is the version you most likely wan to download to use my scripts

	Dynamo 1.3.3 supports Revit 2017, 2018 & 2019

	Dynamo 2.0 is a whole new 'Major Release' - it is not backward-compatible with previous versions (dyn and dyf files are saved as a new file type unreadable to anything lower than 2.0)
		*Dynamo 2.0 is capable of reading dynamo 1.0 - 1.3 files but if you save them they will only be available for 2.0*
		*DO NOT SAVE A 1.3 FILE AT A 2.0 FILE WITHOUT CREATING A BACK UP. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN IT IN 1.3.2 AGAIN*

	Dynamo 2.0 supports Revit 2017, 2018 & 2019
