# Overview of Dynamo and Revit versions and Compatibility

All files in this Git are written for Dynamo version 1.3.2 unless otherwise noted.
Version 1.3.2 can be found here: http://dynamobuilds.com/

 Summary of Dynamo Versions:
 
	Dynamo 1.3.2 supports Revit 2016, 2017 & 2018 (but not 2019)
		*This is the version you most likely want to download to use my scripts

	Dynamo 1.3.3 supports Revit 2017, 2018 & 2019

	Dynamo 2.0 is a whole new 'Major Release' - it is not backward-compatible with previous versions (dyn and dyf files are saved as a new file type unreadable to anything lower than 2.0)
		*Dynamo 2.0 is capable of reading dynamo 1.0 - 1.3 files but if you save them they will only be available for 2.0*
		*DO NOT SAVE A 1.3 FILE AT A 2.0 FILE WITHOUT CREATING A BACK UP. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN IT IN 1.3.2 AGAIN*

	Dynamo 2.0 supports Revit 2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020
