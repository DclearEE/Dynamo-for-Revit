# Dynamo for Revit

Programs and scripts that help automate tasks in Revit.
Mainly electrical scripts with standard project setup, maintance and general Revit tasks sprinkled in.

All Dynamo files, some containg custom Python scripts.


# Overview

All Programs are written for Dynamo version 1.3.2 unless otherwise noted.

 *Summary of Dynamo Versions
 Dynamo 1.3.3   which is virtually the same as 1.3.2, except in the versions it supports
 
Dynamo 1.3.2 supports Revit 2016, 2017 & 2018 (but not 2019)

Dynamo 1.3.3 supports Revit 2017, 2018 & 2019

Dynamo 2.0 is a whole new 'Major Release' - it is not backward-compatible with previous versions (dyn and dyf files are saved in a new format)

	*Dynamo 2.0 is capable of reading dynamo 1.0 - 1.3 files but if you save them they will only be available for 2.0*
	*DO NOT SAVE A 1.3 FILE AT A 2.0 FILE WITHOUT CREATING A BACK UP*

Dynamo 2.0 supports Revit 2017, 2018 & 2019
