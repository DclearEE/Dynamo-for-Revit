You'll need to wrap all inputs in a single list (named IN) and then re-cast each of them to their appropriate type. The last script statement should be left without a semicolon (;) so that the script engine can pick it up as the result.","group":"","keywords":["cs","c#","csharp","bad","monkeys"],"dependencies":[],"contents":"","engine_version":"1.2.0.2690","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"","repository_url":"","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["Core, Version=1.0.0.5, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"]}
