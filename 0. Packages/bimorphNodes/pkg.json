{"license":"MIT","file_hash":null,"name":"bimorphNodes","version":"2.1.4","description":"BimorphNodes are a collection of powerful utility nodes that extend Dynamo for Revit.\r\n\r\nIt includes ultra-efficient clash detection and geometry intersection nodes, which are enabling entirely new workflows in Dynamo by reducing processing time by up to 99.5%. The new clash and containment checking nodes can be found in the BoundingBox and Element classes.\r\n\r\nThe package also includes nodes that convert curves from CAD links or imports using Layer Names as filters. Converted curves are organised into sublists based on their layer. The node can be used to convert the sets of curves into Revit Model Lines without introducing unwanted CAD LineStyles into your project. For enhanced workflows, each set of curves can be mapped to a LineStyle of your choice using the lineStyleMap input.\r\n\r\nIf Revit Detail or Symbolic Curves are needed from a CAD link, there is the DetailCurvesFromCADLayers and SymbolicCurvesFromCADLayers node which provides the same level of functionality to suit detailing or Family workflows.\r\n\r\nBoth of these nodes are optimised to convert more curve types than is currently possible with Explode in Revit or Revit.Elements.Element.Curves in Dynamo. Compatible with DWG or DGN Links and Imports.\r\n\r\nThere are also nodes to duplicate sheets and any placed views, and new geometry nodes which extend Dynamos Curve class with new entirely functionality.\r\n\r\nPackage Nodes:\r\nCLASH DETECTION & ELEMENT CONTAINMENT\r\n- Element intersection with other elements - optimised for rapid results with massive datasets\r\n- Get all elements inside or intersecting a Bounding box (implements a Revit ElementQuickFilter for speed)\r\n\r\nCAD\r\n- Extract curves from CAD Links or Imports using layers as filters\r\n- Extract Detail curves from CAD Links or Imports using layers as filters\r\n- Extract Symbolic curves from CAD Links or Imports using layers as filters\r\n- Query layers in CAD Links or Imports\r\n- Report all CAD Links and Imports in a Revit or Family document\r\n- Set the colour and line weight of CAD (layer) Object Styles\r\n\r\nSHEET\r\n- Duplicate Sheets and placed Views \r\n- Renumber and/or rename Sheets \r\n\r\nCURVE\r\n- Remove duplicate curves\r\n- Find all intersections between a set of curves\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE\r\n- Extract table data from Schedules \r\n\r\nLINESTYLE\r\n- Create and query LineStyles\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit the BimorphNodes dictionary which includes user guides and example graphs:\r\nBimorphNodes: bimorph.co.uk/bimorph-nodes \r\n\r\nIf you want to be the first to hear about the latest news and upcoming releases of bimorphNodes, you can follow us here:\r\n\r\nFacebook:  facebook.com/bimorphBIM\r\nLinkedIn:  linkedin.com/company/bimorph-bim\r\nTwitter:  @bimorphBIM\r\n\r\nCompatible with Revit 2016-2018.1 (2015 is largely supported) and Dynamo v1.0+.
